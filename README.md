# Tic-Tac-Toe Multiplayer

Turn-based demonstration project using Colyseus.

This repository has:
- `server/`: The Colyseus server, with tic-tac-toe room implementation.
- `javascript-pixi/`: A JavaScript/PixiJS client-side project.
- `defold/`: A [Defold](https://defold.com/) client-side project.

# Running the server locally

You'll need two terminal windows open to be able to run this. One for the
client, and one for the server:

**Running the server**

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

**Important files to have look at**

- [registering room](server/index.ts#L20)
- [room and state implementation](server/rooms/tictactoe.ts)
